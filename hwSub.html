<h1 id="instructions-for-all-assignments">Instructions for all
Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="what-should-i-submit-to-carmen-and-how">What should I submit to
Carmen (and how)?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Submit all of the html, javascript, data, and other files that I
would need to run your work. If you are using the p5 editor for your
work, a convenient zip file containing all of these files can be
downloaded from “File/Download” (if Download is not in the menu see if
you are logged in.)</li>
<li>Give me one or more images showing your results (jpegs are
preferred).</li>
<li>If your project result is time-based instead of just an image (e.g.,
involving animation, sound, and/or interaction) then submit a video file
(mp4 or mov) using your favorite screen capture solution (e.g. OBS or
quicktime player). Please keep the file size under control.</li>
<li>Write a little bit about your intent, difficulties, and
accomplishments. Tell me how you feel about your results. Doc, txt, or
pdf file please. Less than a page is fine.</li>
<li>Submit any additional <em>process</em> documentation you’d like me
to see: notebook sketches, failed ideas you tried, steps along the way,
work diary, etc.</li>
<li>ALL of the files mentioned above that you submit to me in Carmen
should be collected inside ONE <em>zipped</em> folder. Not rar or tar.
Zip. So you will be only uploading ONE file to Carmen, named something
like myCoolProject.zip or bob_project_2.zip. All of the things mentioned
above should be inside this zip file, hopefully well organized and named
in subfolders, etc.</li>
<li>When I unzip the (ONE) zip file you submitted to Carmen and look
inside the resulting folder containing all of your files, it should be
obvious what I should look at to see and run your work. (Please don’t
submit 10 things all named like tempFinal3final7.html)</li>
<li>Your project should run without issues. If files it needs to run are
missing, or make global path references to your C: drive, then it won’t
run for me.</li>
<li>Do not submit your work as just links to web sites (e.g. don’t
direct me to youtube, notion, miro, p5.js editor, github, etc). I would
like the actual files for all of the above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Did you understand each of those? If not ask me!</p>
<p>The most common mistakes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>submitting several files, instead of one zip file containing all
your files</li>
<li>forgetting to do number 2 or 3</li>
<li>just describing what you made with no reflection, for number 4</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="sharing">Sharing</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Post some documentation: images, video, links, code, questions,
comments, etc (whatever you’d like to share) in the Teams discussion
thread for the presentation day, so your classmates can see, review,
respond, and discuss.</li>
<li>Everyone will be given ~5 minutes in class to say and show what they
did. Prepare! Note this is not enough time for a line-by-line code
review. Show what you did, then briefly mention highlights and
challenges.</li>
<li>Everyone is welcome to review, comment, and respond in the Teams
discussion thread. Unless specific types of critique are requested,
please err on the side of communicating what worked well and ask
questions about things you want to know more about.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>
<p>All requirements minimally completed will result in a “B” base
grade.</p>
<p>Grades can be raised by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>exceptional commenting and documentation</li>
<li>exceptional attention to visual design</li>
<li>exceptional (successful) creative problem solving</li>
<li>exceptionally interesting ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades will be reduced if:</p>
<ul>
<li>a part is broken in a way that impacts requirements</li>
<li>didn’t satisfy or ignored a requirement</li>
<li>messy hard to follow code (“spaghetti code”)</li>
<li>work shown not appropriate for time given (document your
effort)</li>
<li>you submit work you didn’t create and don’t provide references
(e.g. copied code)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="borrowing">“Borrowing”</h2>
<p>In general, do not use code someone else wrote (e.g. from an online
example or tutorial), without credit/reference, or I may mistakenly
think you wrote it. You will not get credit for code someone else wrote.
If the code looks beyond your knowledge, I will have to spend time
searching for it.</p>
<p>Usually this happens when a student copies code from a tutorial they
watched that is not something we have learned how to do yet in class
(and possibly will not learn about.)</p>
<p>This is not black and white. At one extreme, a simple one line
example might show the way that you set the drawing color, or draw a
line. You may copy that. Putting the URL of where you learned to do
something is always encouraged. Feel free to ask me if you have any
doubt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider the case of code that does something
visually interesting that your viewer will find impressive, mistakenly
thinking you wrote it (“WOW!”). If you are using the found code because
it does something you think is interesting, I’d encourage you to not do
so. If you do so anyways, you MUST give them credit. If you don’t then
you put yourself at risk. Please see the syllabus for specifics of the
university academic misconduct policies.</p>
<p>In short, the more clever someone else’s work is, the less you should
be using it. In this class I do not want you to start with an idea and
then find someone’s code that does that. I instead want you to explore
what YOU can make using the code that YOU are learning to write.</p>
<p>Even if you reference the person’s work, I would not recommend you
hand in what is mostly a tutorial or example that you found and modified
because <em>you will not get credit for code someone else
wrote.</em></p>
<p>Please ask me if you have specific questions about this.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<p><strong>“What can this do? What can I make with that?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For your first time working with ANY new technology tool, when
you have a deadline, you will likely have a much better experience if
you explore its capabilities instead of trying to force a predetermined
result.</p></li>
<li><p>Start by figuring out what you <em>can</em> easily do, then work
with those capabilities, instead of deciding first what you want to do,
and then trying to figure out how to do it. I will repeat this all
semester. (“If there’s one thing that I learned in this course it was to
start with what you know and build on that.” -Student)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Homework is so time consuming!”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>About six hours per week of outside work is expected (3 credits * 3
hours/credit - 3 hours in class = 6 hours)</li>
<li>Try iterative design: get it minimally done, then keep making it
better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“It’s (still) not working!”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please seek help or “go around” problems, instead of grinding with
no progress.</li>
<li>Email me. Ask that question. It’s probably something small. A few
minutes could save you hours.</li>
<li>Make and test small changes to something that works before going
further.</li>
<li>Go back to something that worked and compare your changes, line by
line.</li>
<li>Always have something that worked previously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“My computer died and I had to start over from scratch
yesterday”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please please please make frequent backups, preferably
automated.</li>
<li>Don’t keep overwriting the same file. You need to be able to return
to a previous version when everything stops working.</li>
</ul>
